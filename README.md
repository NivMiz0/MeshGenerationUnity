# MeshGenerationUnity
A couple algorithms I wrote to distribute vertices along a sphere with a variable number on desired vertices. 3D algorithm is a WIP as the distribution of the points is very uneven at the moment. Mesh is visualized using unity.

The algorithms were written as a part of me experimenting with visualizing analytic geometry in unity, so I wrote them without the aid of the internet.
